What is RAG and How It Works

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an advanced technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that combines two powerful capabilities: retrieving relevant information from a database or knowledge source and generating natural language responses based on that information.

How RAG Works:

Retrieval Step:

When a user asks a question, the system first retrieves relevant documents, passages, or pieces of information from an external knowledge base (such as Wikipedia, a database, or custom content).

This retrieval is often performed using methods like dense vector search, where both the query and documents are embedded into vectors and similarity is measured.

Augmentation Step:

The retrieved information is then fed into a generative model.

This model uses both the original user query and the retrieved content to generate a coherent, informed, and contextually relevant response.

Generation Step:

The generative model (often a language model like GPT, T5, or similar) produces the final answer, blending retrieved facts with fluent natural language.

Key Advantages of RAG:

Improved Accuracy: By consulting external information, the model can produce more accurate and fact-based answers.

Efficiency: It reduces the need to train massive models with all the world's knowledge baked in; instead, knowledge can be retrieved when needed.

Flexibility: The knowledge base can be updated without needing to retrain the model.

Typical Applications:

Question Answering Systems

Chatbots

Virtual Assistants

Search Engines with Natural Language Capabilities

In summary, RAG is a powerful approach that bridges the gap between static knowledge embedded in a model and dynamic, updatable information stored externally, leading to more intelligent and up-to-date AI systems.
